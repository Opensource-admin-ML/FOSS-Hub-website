## Guidelines for contributing

The OpenSource Team and Development Team at MapleLabs welcome contributions to this repository. 

If you'd like to make code contributions or content contributions locally, follow the contribution guidelines below.

## Getting started

### Local development

You can serve this site locally to quickly see your changes and additions before you PR them. To get started, navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up, as follows:

```shell
cd FOSS-HUB-website/
yarn
yarn start
```

Your site is now running at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)!

The first time you build the site locally, it will take upwards of 5 minutes. This is normal, and will take signifigantly less time afterwards.

### Dependencies

Node v18 is used in this project as specified in [.nvmrc](https://github.com/newrelic/developer-website/blob/master/.nvmrc).

### Cloning vs forking

Contact the MapleLabs Development team if you need write access. Permission for write access is reserved with MapleLabs.

To contribute without write access, you can [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repository and contribute as needed. If you're planning to leave a fork open for a long time (for example, you're working on a complex set of changes), [sync your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork) occasionally to avoid merge conflicts.

This is a template-driven codebase where we encourage developers to create new reusable templates which can be used to render the website. Please feel free to create generic templates which serve the purpose of rendering the content. Once you develop your template, please test it using the storybook. You can also refer to the storybook for all existing templates.

Please follow these steps to generate the boiler plate code for the template: 

```shell
cd FOSS-HUB-website/
yarn
yarn gen
```

Please follow these steps to host the storybook : 

```shell
cd FOSS-HUB-website/
yarn
yarn storybook
```
The storybook will be running at [`http://localhost:6006`](http://localhost:6006)

### Want to use the repo to build your website?

Our website is developed using pre-defined templates which are developed by us. You can make use of these templates to create your website or create new templates (sections/header/footer). [Generate templates by running the command yarn gen]

Once your templates are ready, test it by running storybook locally.The command to run storybook locally is mentioned above in contribute section.

Now you have to place your templates and your static content for your website in main.config.ts file. Once all your content and templates are placed as per your requirement, your website is ready to launch!!
