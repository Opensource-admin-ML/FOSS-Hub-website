  ### Introduction
  
  From the start of my career, I have been a consumer of the open-source community. It all started with using open-source tools and products. I am fascinated with the support I get from the community and the support an open-source community provides is much more than proprietary software.     
  I have always wanted to be part of a group where I could provide a solution to a problem that can help consumers of software. And I feel a straightforward way to do that is to get involved in an open-source project and contribute by solving an issue or enhancing the project.`,
